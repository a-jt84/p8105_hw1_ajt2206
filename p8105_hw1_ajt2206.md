``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Defining temp as the temp variable within the early_january_weather
dataset.

``` r
temp<- pull(early_january_weather,temp)
```

**Description of Variables and Dataset**

1.  This dataset provides hourly meterological data for LGA, JFK, and
    EWR for the month of January 2013.

2.  The variables are as follows origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
    dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
    visib, time_hour.

3.  Key variables are defined as the follolwing. temp: Temperature in F.
    humid: relative humidity. time_hour: Date and hour of the recording
    as a POSIXct date.

4.  There are 358 rows and 15 columns.

5.  The mean temperature is 39.58 degrees Fahrenheit.

**Plotting temp vs. time_hour**

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color=humid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Scatterplot of Time_hour vs. Temperature")
```

![](p8105_hw1_ajt2206_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

**Patterns in the data**

- From the graph, we can see that temperature appears to generally
  increase through the week of observations before dropping quickly
  around January 14th.

- There were many fluctuations in temperature. Fluctuations in
  temperature likely occurred throughout the day with higher
  temperatures during the day and lower temperatures during the night.

**Saving Scatterplot to Github**

``` r
ggsave("hw1_scatterplot.png", plot= last_plot(), width=6, height=4, dpi = 300)
```

# Problem 2

Creating a data frame & pulling out variables from within the data frame

``` r
hw2_df= 
  tibble(
    ran_samp = rnorm(10),
    log_vec = ran_samp>0,
    char_vec = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    fact_vec= factor(rep(c("Level 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"), times= c(4, 3, 3)))
  )
                     

ran_samp <- pull(hw2_df,ran_samp)
log_vec <- pull(hw2_df,log_vec)
char_vec <- pull(hw2_df,char_vec)
fact_vec <- pull(hw2_df,fact_vec)
```

Running means on the 4 variables:

``` r
mean(ran_samp)
```

    ## [1] 0.04774742

``` r
mean(log_vec)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(char_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(fact_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fact_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Mean Works:

- Random Sample

- Logical Vector

Mean Does Not Work:

- Character Vector

- Factor Vector

**Attempting to convert logical, character, and factor vectors to
numeric**

``` r
as.numeric(log_vec)
```

    ##  [1] 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1

``` r
as.numeric(char_vec)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(fact_vec)
```

    ##  [1] 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3

**Outcome** Logical Vector and Factor Vector were both converted to
Numeric. Character Vector was converted to numeric; however, there was a
warning message that this occurred via coercion. All the characters were
converted to NAs.

**Why** The logical vector we created is based off a True or False which
can easily be converted to a binary number. Likewise the Factor Vector
exists in three levels which can also be converted from the level to a
number (1 through 3). The character vector however does not have a clear
way to convert to a numeric which is why the system warns that the
character vector was converted via coercion.

**Correspondence with attempting to take the Mean** Overall yes,
transforming our data to numeric does partially explain what happened
when we tried to take the mean. For the logical vector, I could both
calculate a mean and convert it to numeric easily. For the character
vector, I could not calculate a mean and it was difficult to convert to
numeric. The factor vector is more mixed: I could not take a mean;
however, I could convert the data into numeric easily. The Categorical
Data makes it where the system cannot run a mean since the data could be
in Nominal Categories.
